# infinity-core

A fresh start that combines the best parts of the Infinity projects.

## What is here

- **`crates/infinity-kernel`** — ICK, a deterministic governance kernel. It judges
  agent-proposed actions and returns an `allow`, `deny` or `await` receipt. It does
  not call providers, tools or cloud services. Taken from `infinity-runtime`.
- **`crates/infinity-cli`** — command-line front end for the kernel.
- **`contracts/`, `fixtures/`, `demo/`** — the JSON contracts, test cases and sample policy.

## Checks

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --tests -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

## Governed chat runtime

`runtime/` is a small standard-library Python package. Each chat turn is turned into
a proposal and sent to the kernel first. The model is called only if the kernel says
`allow`; the receipt is appended to a log. Message text is never put in the proposal.

```bash
cargo build
GROQ_API_KEY=... python -m runtime "What is the capital of France?" --provider groq
python -m pytest        # offline tests, no keys needed
```

Providers: `groq`, `nvidia`, `openrouter` (keys in `GROQ_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`,
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; models can be overridden with `INFINITY_<NAME>_MODEL`).
All three were checked live. Reasoning models get a 256-token minimum and a
no-thinking or low-reasoning setting so short replies are not left empty.

## Planned

1. Receipt chaining across turns (the CLI currently issues each receipt unlinked).
2. A minimal operator surface.
